To build to UML Console Application:

1. Compile Console.java with "javac Console.java". All the .java files which Console relies on should end up compiling as well.
If this doesn't work, then explicitly compile all the .java files with "javac Console.java WorkingProject.java Relationship.java ClassObject.java Attribute.java".
2. Make sure "HelpDocument.txt" is in the same directory as Console.java (this is needed for the help command to function).
3. Run the Console application with "java Console"
4. Enjoy!
